## Indoor location monitoring

ILM is an indoor location monitoring application, using BLE Beacons. It aims to let the teachers and students find their way to a point of interest indoor (navigate inside of University building) such as specific laboratory/lecture room, coffee machine, etc.. where GPS/GNSS singal is not available.

Teachers and students can sign up to the application, and once they verify their email address 
with the mail sent to their University email address, they will be able to use the application with its full functionality.

Once user passes through onboarding process he/she will be able to see the target locations in outdoor map, and once she/he is near the building the map can be changed into indoor map.
