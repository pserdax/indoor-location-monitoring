## Indoor location monitoring

ILM is an indoor location monitoring application, using BLE Beacons. It aims to let the teachers and students find their way to a point of interest indoor (or navigate inside of University building) such as specific laboratory/lecture room, coffee machine, etc.. where GPS/GNSS singal is not available.
